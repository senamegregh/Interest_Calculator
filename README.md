Simple Interest Calculator
The calculator is used to calculate the interest someone would get from an amount of deposit, based on the rate value and the number of years.
The index.html file contains html codes that set the structure and the contents of the application.
The style.css file has codes that output the sizes, the format of the index.html file. It also makes the yellow highlight output of the computing result of the interest.
The script.js file contains javascript codes that compute the request from the application page. The javascript code defines the rate changes, the conditions for the calculation depending on the Amount field input data, the interest rate and number of years selected, then compute the data to give the interest amount.
index.html, style.css and script.js combined, make the structure of the application which runs without any server implementation.
